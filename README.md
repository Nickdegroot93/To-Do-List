### About the project

I've created a to-do app to give some more experience and feel for the react basics. The to-do data is being saved and fetched from local storage. I also implemented dragging and dropping to-do's with react-beautiful-dnd. For the styling of the project I deciced to try something new and went with Styled Components and implemented an incredibly useless light/dark mode switch.
